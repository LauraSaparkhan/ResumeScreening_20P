# üìÑ Resume Matcher ‚Äì Final Documentation

## üìå Overview

This project compares a candidate‚Äôs resume to a job description using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It outputs match scores for keywords, named entities, years of experience, and semantic similarity using SpaCy and Sentence-BERT.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- ‚úÖ Extracts text from `.txt`, `.pdf`, and `.docx` files  
- ‚úÖ Cleans and lemmatizes text using SpaCy  
- ‚úÖ Identifies and compares named entities  
- ‚úÖ Extracts years of experience  
- ‚úÖ Computes keyword match score  
- ‚úÖ Computes semantic similarity using BERT  

---

## üß† Technologies Used

- `spaCy` (for NLP and NER)
- `SentenceTransformers` (BERT-based semantic similarity)
- `PyMuPDF` (`fitz`, for PDF parsing)
- `python-docx` (for reading DOCX files)
- `re` (for regex pattern matching)

## üîç Function Summaries

### `extract_text(file)`
Extracts plain text from `.txt`, `.pdf`, and `.docx`. Uses `fitz` for PDFs and `docx` for Word files.

---

### `preprocess_text(text)`
- Removes stopwords and punctuation
- Lemmatizes tokens (e.g., ‚Äúworking‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúwork‚Äù)

---

### `extract_entities(text)`
Detects named entities from text using SpaCy.  
Extracts entities of type:
- `ORG` (organizations)
- `PRODUCT`
- `SKILL` (custom)
- `GPE` (geopolitical locations)
- `PERSON`

---

### `extract_experience_years(text)`
Uses regex to search for experience patterns (e.g., ‚Äú5 years of experience‚Äù).

---

### `compare_keyword_match(resume_text, job_text)`
- Tokenizes and lemmatizes both inputs
- Calculates percentage of shared keywords

---

### `compare_entity_match(resume_text, job_text)`
- Extracts named entities from both inputs
- Calculates percentage of matching entities

---

### `compare_experience(resume_text, job_text)`
- Extracts numerical experience values
- Compares resume and job requirements

---

### `compare_semantic_similarity(resume_text, job_text)`
- Encodes both texts using BERT
- Returns cosine similarity score (0 to 1)
